While the web is full of reviews, this repo aims to cut through some of the noise and give yet another, user-level perspective. I'll cover the open-source apps I rely on, the commercial software I haven't found good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a> or open-source replacements for, the settings and configurations I personally use, and even the small annoyances that I've run into over time.<br><br>

Whether you're considering switching to GrapheneOS, have already jumped ship, or are just curious about using **a privacy-focused, de-googled Android fork** — this hopefully helps to get some insights.
